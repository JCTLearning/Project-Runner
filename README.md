# Project-Runner
This is a  program designed to help Track &amp; Cross Country coaches keep track of their stats.
# Progress
  Server is built (most of it) the only thing that remains is cleaning up and adding SS to it. I need to add in the code for db to xml as well. 
  Electron progress: 
    The program can pull data from XML, it just needs to be neat and clean now... Sockets need to be built as well.
